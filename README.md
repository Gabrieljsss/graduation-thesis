## Abstract

This project focuses on the refactoring of the LHCb Membership Web Application at CERN, transitioning from a framework-based monolithic structure to a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Hexagonal Architecture**-inspired Modular Monolith. The redesign enhances modularity, encapsulation, and separation of concerns, aligning the system with modern software development practices.

Key innovations include:
- Implementation of a search library for optimized database queries.
- Adoption of REST APIs for frontend-backend communication.
- Development of advanced workflow tracking for collaboration management.

This project introduces a more flexible and scalable architecture, addressing limitations of the previous system while improving productivity for the collaboration.

## Project Goals

1. **Revalidate Software Requirements**: Collect and refine the requirements for the LHCb Membership System.
2. **Architecture Redesign**: Migrate to a modern, modular monolithic architecture using DDD principles.
3. **Search Tool Implementation**: Replace the legacy Super Search with a more robust solution.
4. **Enhanced Collaboration Tools**: Introduce workflow tracking and improved user interfaces.
5. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrate productivity improvements through the adoption of the new architecture.

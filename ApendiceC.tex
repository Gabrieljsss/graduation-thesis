``Gabriel's work has been exceptionally good. He was very proactive and looked for solutions, taking into account constraints and possible outcomes and investigating all related aspects of a problem. He was always very conscientious and very careful to verify his work fulfilled the requirements given by the stakeholders. The work he did for the LHCb membership and the equipment management is highly valuable and eased administrative tasks of the LHCb secretariat and Radiation Protection Experts. We use the Glance systems almost daily. He put the basis of a modular, very powerful super-search and workflow management that we are exploiting in other new systems we are putting in place. He did it in a general way such that they can also be used by other experiments. In addition, he did so in the very difficult time of Covid, with the constraints it caused. Gabriel was also very good with transmitting his knowledge to the new students that joined him in LHCb and the other students working on Glance in the other experiments. For me, Gabriel was one of the best students we had, careful, thoughtful, and he became extremely competent in the two years he spent with us."
